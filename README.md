# Opxium Engine
 Opxium is a high-performance, minimalistic game engine built with C and Vulkan. Designed for efficiency and low-level control, 
 Opxium provides developers with the power to create stunning real-time graphics with full control over memory, rendering, and performance.

Thats the aim at least, we'll see how building goes.
